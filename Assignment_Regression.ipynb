    "# Introduction Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Many advanced machine learning and data analysis techniques are founded on the principles of regression. A solid understanding of regression is often essential for mastering more complex algorithms, such as logistic regression, polynomial regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso, linear kernels in SVM, and neural networks. In this first assignment, we will explore the fundamentals of regression to establish a strong foundation for a wide range of machine learning applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook consists the following parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [A: data preparation regression](#01)\n",
    "- [B: Implementation of the cost function algorithm](#02)\n",
    "- [C: Implementation of the gradient descent algorithm](#03)\n",
    "- [D: Implementation of a regularization parameter](#04)\n",
    "- [E: Data preparation logistic regression](#051)\n",
    "- [F: Implementation of logistic regression](#05)\n",
    "- [G: Validate the outcome](#06)\n",

    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this two weeks you will be able to:\n",
    "- Understand the fundamental concepts of regression models.\n",
    "- Grasp the construction and significance of feature weights in modeling.\n",
    "- Understand model error, learning rates, and regularization factors and their impact on model performance.\n",
    "- Translate theoretical concepts into functional code, implementing machine learning models.\n",
    "- Articulate the appropriate use cases for different regression algorithms.\n",
    "- Build your own regression classes from scratch, implementing methods for fitting the model and making predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "- Ensure you fully understand the requirements and objectives of the assignment.\n",
    "- If you need additional context or clarification, please check the provided videos or background literature.\n",
    "- Work through each part of the assignment methodically, ensuring all tasks are completed.\n",
    "- Using the code from the tasks A to E, create **python files** with a classes that models data using (logistic) regression. These classes should include the following methods:\n",
    "  - `fit()`: A method to fit the model to the training data, determining the best weights.\n",
    "  - `predict()`: A method to predict the outcome for new input data using the trained model.\n",
    "  - `predict_proba()`: (optional) returns an array with probability per class for the specific sample.\n",
    "- Submit a repository with a directory `regression` that includes:\n",
    "  - This finished notebook and supportive code snippets\n",
    "  - The python file with the regression class \n",
    "  - The python file with the logistic regression class\n",
    "  - The python file with the polynomial class (optional)\n",
    "  - An evaluation document that details specific scenarios or datasets where each type of regression (linear, logistic, polynomial) is appropriate or inappropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Notes:\n",
    "- Do not add datafiles to your repository. Repositories with datafiles will not be accepted\n",
    "- Class solutions should be delivered in python files. Not in notebooks\n",
    "- When AI tools are used, you must provide proper references and explanations for how they were utilized. Failure to do so will be considered as academic fraud\n",
    "- The bonus assignment (H) is not mandatory\n",
    "- Use PEP8 \n",

    "\n",
    "Regularization works by adding the penalty term to the cost function used in linear regression. The penalty term controls the magnitude of the coefficients. The regularization term prevents the coefficients from becoming too large. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three regularization methods. Lasso, Ridge and Elastic net\n",
    "The ridge regression formula is \n",
    "$$ J(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} ( h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)} ) ^2 + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^{m}\\theta_j^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the regularization term is \n",
    "$$ \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^{m}\\theta_j^2$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "In gradient descent, you update the parameters $theta_j$ (except for the intercept term) by subtracting the learning rate times the gradient. The update rules are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\theta_j := \\theta_j - \\alpha \\left( \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) x_j^{(i)} + \\frac{\\lambda}{m} \\theta_j \\right) \\quad \\text{for} \\; j \\geq 1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\theta_0 := \\theta_0 - \\alpha \\left( \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A higher value of λ increases the penalty on the coefficients, effectively shrinking them towards zero but never exactly zero, thus preventing overfitting by reducing the model complexity. A lower value of λ reduces the impact of the regularization term, allowing the model to fit the data more closely, which could lead to overfitting if the model becomes too complex. λ = 1 is considered as moderate regularization.\n",

Best practise is to compose a regression class with all methods and parameters to set (learningrate, lambda, number of itterations), including some feedback methods (transfered back coefficients and cost function plot). Use a method `fit()` to create a linear regresssion model equation and `predict` to use the model. Evaluate the usage and performance of your model.  "

    "The logistic regression use case in this notebook is based on data from the `ChemBL` database [2], a comprehensive resource that provides information on the bioactivity of small molecules and their biological targets. Specifically, we will focus on `CHEMBL2034`[2], which pertains to the Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR), a nuclear receptor that regulates gene expression in response to steroid hormones. The GR plays a critical role in various physiological processes, including inflammation, metabolism, and immune response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the bioactivity of compounds targeting the GR is essential for drug discovery and the development of therapeutics aimed at modulating its activity. The CHEMBL2034 dataset includes molecular structure data (SMILES) and bioactivity data. By analyzing structure-activity relationships (SAR), researchers can understand how modifications in a molecule's structure influence its bioactivity. This knowledge is crucial for optimizing drug candidates. In this use case we will predict if the molecule developes significant bioactivity or not.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To use the ChemBL database we can use the chembl_webresource_client API. The API fetches bioactivity data for compounds targeting the GR, filtered by IC50 values. Fields from the dataset we will work with are the `canonical_smiles` providing the molecular structure, and `standard_value` (IC50) which is used to determine bioactivity. We transfer bioactivity to 0 or 1, in order to use it as a class. The `rdkit` (rdkit.org/docs) [4] can be used to compute features from the SMILE structure. \n",
